User Interview Notes — Marketing Executive

Role context: Operates campaigns daily, inside Google Ads / Meta / LinkedIn. Does most of the manual reporting today.

Q1. What is the purpose of this dashboard?

A: For me, it’s my daily control center. I want to see how all my campaigns are performing across platforms in one place so I can make quick decisions about budgets, pausing ads, and launching optimizations.

Follow-up: What problem does it solve for you personally?
A: It eliminates the need to log in to three platforms and manually merge their data. It also reduces the time I spend building Excel reports and charts every week.

Q2. How does this area fit into your overall role and responsibilities?

A: I’m responsible for:

Running 3–5 campaigns at a time

Monitoring spend and performance daily

Optimizing bids, audiences, and creatives

Preparing weekly and monthly performance reports for my manager

Follow-up: Where do you feel the most friction right now?
A:

Manually downloading reports, cleaning them, and combining them.

It’s slow to spot underperforming ads across platforms.

It’s not easy to see if we are on track with the monthly budget unless I do my own calculations.

Q3. What systems are the source of truth for this?

A:

Google Ads

Meta Ads Manager (for Facebook and Instagram)

LinkedIn Campaign Manager

All performance metrics come from their APIs.

Follow-up: Any differences between them that matter?
A: Attribution windows and conversion definitions can vary, so we need them standardized for the dashboard. Also, sometimes campaigns might be in different currencies, so we need them normalized to one currency.

Q4. What decisions or actions do you want your team to be able to take once they have this dashboard?

A: On a daily and weekly basis, we need to:

Increase or decrease campaign budgets

Pause ads that are too expensive or not converting

Identify the best-performing campaigns and ads to scale

Decide which channels to favor in the short term

Catch if we’re at risk of exceeding the monthly budget

Decide when to refresh creatives

Follow-up: What would you like to see on screen to support those decisions?
A:

Clear KPIs for spend, conversions, cost per conversion, and ROAS

A list or chart showing spend vs conversions for each campaign

Channel comparison (Google vs Meta vs LinkedIn)

A funnel from impressions → clicks → conversions

A top/bottom list of ads based on ROAS or cost per conversion

Q5. How do you currently track this?

Metrics:
A: I export data from each platform including spend, impressions, clicks, conversions, and sometimes conversion value. In Excel, I calculate cost per conversion, ROAS, CTR, CPC, and conversion rate.

Analyses / charts / questions:
A:

Pivot tables by campaign and platform

Line charts for daily spend and daily conversions

Bar charts comparing campaigns

Some manual funnel calculations (impressions to clicks to conversions)

How do you receive the report? How frequently?
A:

I generate weekly and monthly reports in Excel and share them as PPT or PDF via email.

My manager uses them in monthly reviews.

Follow-up: How much time does this take you?
A: Roughly 3 to 4 hours a week just on data export, cleaning, and reporting.

Q6. Do you want the dashboard organised and structured a certain way? (tabs)

A: Yes, I think of it in two main tabs:

Tab 1: Campaign Performance

High-level KPIs: total spend, total conversions, cost per conversion, ROAS

Daily performance trends

Spend vs conversions by campaign

A campaign summary table with all key metrics

Tab 2: Channel & Optimization

Performance by channel (Google, Meta, LinkedIn)

Conversion funnel view

Cost per conversion trend

Top 5 / bottom 5 ads by ROAS

Follow-up: Any global filters you always need?
A:

Date range (with presets like This Month, Last 30 Days, Last 7 Days)

Campaign selector (multi-select)

Channel selector (Google, Meta, LinkedIn)

Possibly campaign objective (Brand Awareness, Lead Gen, Sales/Conversions)

Q7. What are the main things you want the dashboard to contain?
a) What metrics? How do you define them?

A:

Total Spend

Definition: Sum of ad spend across selected campaigns/channels/date range.

Conversions

Definition: Completed conversion actions as per tracking setup (leads, sign-ups, purchases).

Needs consistent definition across platforms.

Cost per Conversion

Calculation: Total spend ÷ total conversions.

Important to distinguish from cost per click.

ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)

Calculation: Conversion value ÷ ad spend.

Display: As a ratio (e.g., 3.5x).

Impressions

Clicks

CTR

Calculation: (Clicks / Impressions) × 100.

CPC (Cost per Click)

Calculation: Spend ÷ clicks.

Conversion Rate

Calculation: (Conversions / Clicks) × 100.

Follow-up: How would you categorize their importance?
A:

Mission-critical: Total spend, conversions, cost per conversion, ROAS, campaign-level summary.

Needed: CTR, CPC, conversion rate, impressions, clicks, daily trends, channel comparison, funnel view.

Good to have: Top/bottom ad tables, additional breakdowns like objective.

b) What analyses or charts or questions?

A:

KPIs (Cards): Spend, conversions, cost per conversion, ROAS, with comparison to previous period.

Spend vs Conversions by Campaign: Grouped/dual-axis bar chart, sorted by spend.

Daily Performance Trend: Line chart for spend vs conversions over last 30 days.

Campaign Summary Table: With Campaign, Channel, Spend, Impressions, Clicks, CTR, Conversions, CPC, Cost per Conversion, ROAS.

Performance by Channel: Grouped bar showing spend, conversions, ROAS per platform.

Conversion Funnel: Impressions → Clicks → Conversions with conversion rates between stages.

Cost per Conversion Trend: Line chart with cost per conversion over time, with trend.

Top 5 / Bottom 5 Ads by ROAS: Two tables with Ad Name, Campaign, Spend, Conversions, ROAS, with a minimum spend threshold to avoid noise.

Follow-up: Any specific questions you always ask during analysis?
A:

How much have we spent so far this month?

Are we pacing correctly vs monthly budget?

Which campaigns are spending the most and are they justified by conversions and ROAS?

Which channel is performing best overall?

Are campaigns improving or declining compared to previous period?

Where in the funnel are we losing people?

Which ads are our top performers and which need to be paused?

Q8. (Loop) For each metric and analysis:

Example: Cost per Conversion

Importance: Mission-critical.

Data question: “How efficiently are we acquiring conversions over this period?”

Chart type: KPI card with trend sparkline, plus line chart over time.

Actions/Triggers: If cost per conversion goes above threshold, I’ll pause or reduce budgets, adjust bids or targeting, or refresh creative.

Deep dive trigger: Sudden spike or upward trend for 3+ days.

Example: ROAS

Importance: Mission-critical.

Data question: “Are we making enough revenue relative to our spend?”

Chart type: KPI card showing ratio, comparison to previous period, and possibly a bar chart by campaign or channel.

Actions/Triggers: ROAS below 3x triggers investigation and likely budget cuts or pauses.

Deep dive trigger: ROAS deterioration on a key campaign or channel.

Example: Top/Bottom Ads

Importance: Needed.

Data question: “Which creatives should we scale, and which should we stop?”

Chart type: Two tables side by side, with filters including minimum spend.

Actions/Triggers: Scale winners; pause losers; inform new creative briefs.

Deep dive trigger: An ad that’s either performing extremely well or extremely poorly.

Q9. What urgent things do you want highlighted in the dashboard?

A:

Warnings when we’ve hit ~80% of monthly budget.

Campaigns with sharp drops in conversions or ROAS.

Significant increases in cost per conversion.

Channels where performance is deteriorating faster than others.

Follow-up: How should these appear?
A: Visual alerts or flags near the relevant KPIs and within campaign/ad tables (e.g., red highlight, warning icons).

Q10. Can you tell me how this general area functions? Processes, people, etc.

A:

Daily: I check performance, tweak bids, audiences, and sometimes creatives.

Weekly: We review campaigns in more detail and decide budget reallocations.

Monthly: We do a full performance review and plan the next month’s campaigns and channel mix.

Follow-up: How do you view it and manage it?
A:

I start with high-level KPIs, then drill down into campaigns and ads.

I compare this month vs last month, and sometimes last 30 days vs previous 30 days.

I keep an eye on overall funnel performance and individual channel trends.

Follow-up: How do you decide if things are going well?
A:

ROAS and cost per conversion within targets.

Stable or improving conversion volume.

No surprise budget overruns.

Healthy click-through and conversion rates.

Q11. How recent does the data need to be? How frequently do you want it refreshed?

A:

Daily refresh is essential; data should be up-to-date by around 6–8 AM so we can act during the day.

A manual refresh button would be helpful for intra-day checks, but we understand that platform latency of 24–48 hours is normal.

Follow-up: Any performance expectations for the dashboard itself?
A:

It should load within a few seconds (<5 seconds ideally).

Filters should apply quickly (<2 seconds).

It should still work smoothly even if we have 20 or so campaigns active.

Follow-up: Any usability or access needs?
A:

Mobile-responsive so we can check on the go.

Ability to export tables to CSV or Excel for ad-hoc analysis.

Drill-through from campaign to ad level.

Different access levels: full access for marketing, read-only for finance, summary view for executives.
