1. Stakeholder Interview Notes — Marketing Manager

Role context: Owns performance of 3–5 concurrent digital campaigns across Google, Meta, LinkedIn. Manages budget and outcomes, reports up to Director/CMO.

Q1. What dashboard do you want?

A: I want a single performance dashboard for all our paid digital campaigns—Google Ads, Meta, and LinkedIn—so that I can see how everything is performing at a glance.

Follow-up: When you say “performance”, what does that mean to you?
A: Spend, conversions, cost per conversion, and ROAS primarily. I also want to see how these metrics vary by campaign and channel without logging into three different platforms.

Follow-up: Is this one dashboard or multiple?
A: One dashboard with at least two main sections or tabs:

An overall Campaign Performance view

A Channel & Optimization view where I can compare platforms and identify winners/losers.

Q2. What is the reason for wanting the dashboard?

A: Right now, we struggle to track performance across platforms simultaneously. It’s hard to know which campaigns and channels give us the best ROI and where to reallocate budget. I want a unified view so we can optimize ad spend in close to real time.

Follow-up: What are the pain points with the current setup?
A:

Data is scattered across Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn.

My team exports CSVs, builds spreadsheets, and prepares manual reports.

By the time we spot underperforming campaigns or overspend, we’ve often wasted budget.

Follow-up: What would “better” look like?
A:

I should be able to identify top and bottom campaigns in under a minute.

We should be using the dashboard actively in our weekly budget conversations.

Cost per conversion should come down once we take action based on what we see.

Q3. Who will be using this dashboard?

A:

Primary: The Marketing Executives who run campaigns day-to-day.

Me (Marketing Manager): For performance oversight and monthly reviews.

Secondary: Director/CMO and Finance team as read-only consumers.

Follow-up: How will each of them use it differently?
A:

Executives: daily decisions—budgets, pausing ads, spotting issues.

Me: weekly and monthly performance reviews, channel prioritization, and planning.

Director/CMO: high-level overview of ROI and efficiency trends.

Finance: budget vs. actual spend.

Q4. What systems are the source of truth for this?

A:

Google Ads API

Meta Ads API (Facebook/Instagram)

LinkedIn Campaign Manager API
For budgets, we either pull from a finance sheet or manually input monthly budget targets.

Follow-up: Any other tools you want integrated now?
A: Not in phase one. CRM or revenue-level integration is a future enhancement.

Follow-up: Any constraints on data?
A: We should have at least 90 days of historical data for trend analysis and time comparisons.

Q5. What business results or outcomes do you expect from it?

A:

Make budget allocation more data-driven and faster.

Reduce cost per conversion by around 10–15% within a couple of months.

Minimize wasted spend on underperforming campaigns and ads.

Use the dashboard as the reference point in our monthly budget review meetings.

Save the team several hours a week on manual reporting.

Follow-up: How would you measure success of the dashboard itself?
A:

My team can find top/bottom campaigns in under 60 seconds.

Weekly budget reallocation decisions are made using the dashboard.

Underperforming ads are paused within 24–48 hours of being flagged.

Marketing executives report saving at least 3 hours per week on reporting.

100% of monthly budget review meetings reference dashboard views.

Q6. What decisions or actions do you want your team to be able to take once they have this dashboard?

A:

Daily/Weekly decisions:

Which campaigns to increase or decrease budgets for

Which ads to pause because their performance is poor

Which ads/campaigns to scale because ROAS is strong

Whether our current pace of spend will blow through the monthly budget

When to refresh creatives if conversion rates or CTR are dropping

Strategic decisions:

Which channels (Google, Meta, LinkedIn) to prioritize next month

Whether to expand high-performing campaigns or launch new ones

When to adjust targeting and audiences

Whether to shift spend from brand awareness to conversion-focused campaigns

Whether the overall marketing budget can be trimmed or needs to be increased

Follow-up: Can you give examples of specific actions you’d expect?
A:

Increase daily budget for campaigns with ROAS above 3x.

Pause ads whose cost per conversion exceeds our internal target.

Reallocate budget from underperforming channels (e.g., LinkedIn) to better ones (e.g., Meta) if data supports it.

Trigger creative refresh when CTR drops or conversion rates soften.

Set up A/B tests for campaigns that are underperforming but important.

Adjust bids or targeting when we’re losing impression share.

Q7. What are the main things you want this to contain?
a) What metrics?

A:

Total spend

Total conversions

Cost per conversion

ROAS

Impressions

Clicks

CTR

CPC

Conversion rate

Follow-up: Any priorities among these?
A: Mission-critical: total spend, conversions, cost per conversion, ROAS, and campaign-level summary. The rest are needed to explain “why”.

b) What analyses or charts or questions?

A:

KPIs showing spend, conversions, CPC (per conversion), and ROAS

Spend vs conversions per campaign

Daily performance trend over time

Channel-level performance comparison

Funnel from impressions → clicks → conversions

Top 5 and bottom 5 ads by ROAS

Follow-up: Are there specific business questions you always ask in reviews?
A: Yes:

How much have we spent this month so far?

Are we on track to stay within budget?

Which campaigns are consuming most of the budget?

How many conversions have we generated this month?

What is our current cost per conversion and is it acceptable?

What’s our overall ROAS?

Which campaigns and channels deliver the best ROAS?

Are we improving or declining over time?

Where in the funnel are we losing customers?

Which ads are the clear winners and losers?

How is CTR varying by campaign?

Q8. Can you tell me how this general area functions? Processes, people, etc.

A:

We typically have 3–5 active campaigns at any time across the three platforms.

Marketing Executives manage day-to-day operations: creation, optimization, bidding.

I oversee performance, strategy, and budget allocation.

We do daily checks on performance, weekly optimization meetings, and monthly budget and strategy reviews.

Follow-up: How do you view it and manage it?
A:

I look at ROAS and cost per conversion as primary health indicators.

I check that spend is pacing correctly against monthly budget.

I watch trends over time—if efficiency is improving or deteriorating.

I also look at channel mix and whether we’re too reliant on any single platform.

Follow-up: How do you decide if things are going well or not?
A:

ROAS above our target (3x or more).

Cost per conversion stable or improving.

No surprise budget overruns.

Funnel metrics (click-through and conversion rates) aren’t deteriorating.

We’re able to pause underperforming ads quickly and shift budget to better ones.

Follow-up: Any assumptions you’re making for this to work?
A:

Conversion tracking must be consistent across platforms (same logic and windows).

Conversion value data must be available or we define standard values per conversion type.

We have at least 3 months of historical data.

Ad naming is consistent so we can track ad-level performance.

Either we operate in a single currency or currency normalization happens before the data reaches the dashboard.
