# Lean BI
A system to apply Lean Principles to BI

## What's in  this repo:
- Accompanying presentation: /Wireframing_Lean_BI_using_AI.pptx
- The Lean BI system at a glance: /Lean_BI_System_Overview.md
- The BYOBI (Build Your Own BI) Master Prompt: /BYOBI_Master_Prompt.md
- A slightly more detailed, sophisticated set of prompts: /ready_prompts/*
- Worked example #1: Department Hiring HR Dashboard: /examples/hr_hiring
- Worked example #2: Marketing - Tactical Campaign Dashboard: /examples/marketing_campaign 

## How to do this on your own:
- First: Explore the Lean BI system overview first (/Lean_BI_System_Overview.md)
- Next: Choose a path. Either generate your own system prompts for each "step" using the Master prompt (/BYOBI_Master_Prompt.md) or use the ones already created here (/ready_prompts/)
- Next: Set up the projects in your AI environment of choice. One Claude / ChatGPT project per "Lean BI Step". Eg. "DRD Maker" is a separate project, which will have multiple chats - one for each of your dashboards. Remember to include /ready_prompts/dashboard.html in Step 6!
- Choose a use case or create your own use case, and get started! The output of one step becomes the input of the next step. Keep going till you finish the last step, and can view the dashboard wireframe
