## INTERVIEW 1: STAKEHOLDER (Head of HR)

**Interviewee:** Sarah Chen, Head of HR
**Date:** November 15, 2024
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Q: What dashboard do you want?**

A: We need a recruitment and hiring pipeline dashboard for our department HR managers. They're managing multiple open positions simultaneously and struggling to get visibility into where things stand without manually pulling data from multiple systems.

---

**Q: What is the reason for wanting the dashboard?**

A: Our HR managers are drowning in the operational complexity of tracking 5-10 open positions each. They spend hours each week pulling status reports for leadership, and we're seeing hiring timelines slip because bottlenecks aren't identified quickly enough. We recently lost two strong candidates because positions were moving too slowly, and we couldn't see the warning signs early enough. We need to shift from reactive to proactive management of our hiring pipeline.

---

**Q: Who will be using this dashboard?**

A: The primary users are our department HR managers - we have about 8 of them across the organization. They're the ones in the trenches managing day-to-day recruiting. Secondary users would be the hiring managers themselves, though they'd have more limited access - just seeing their specific positions rather than the full department view.

---

**Q: What systems are the source of truth for this?**

A: Our Applicant Tracking System is the main source of truth - that's where all candidate data, position data, interview scheduling, and offers live. We'd also need to pull from our HRIS for confirmed hire dates once someone actually starts. The tricky part will be the cost data for recruitment channels - that's currently tracked in spreadsheets and various finance systems, so we'll need to figure out how to centralize that.

---

**Q: What business results or outcomes do you expect from it?**

A: I have specific targets in mind. First, I want our time-to-hire to drop by 15-20% within three months of launching this. Right now we're averaging around 45-50 days and we should be closer to 35-40 for most positions. Second, I want HR managers to save at least 2 hours per week on status reporting - that time should be redirected to actually talking to candidates and hiring managers. Third, I want us making data-driven decisions about recruitment channel spend at least monthly. We're spending significant money on LinkedIn Recruiter and various job boards, but we have no idea what our ROI is.

---

**Q: What decisions or actions do you want your team to be able to take once they have this dashboard?**

A: Day-to-day, I want them to quickly identify which positions are lagging and need immediate attention - whether that means sourcing more candidates, expediting interview scheduling, or following up with candidates stuck at a stage. I also want them to see drop-off patterns so they can intervene before a pipeline runs dry.

Strategically, I want them making smarter decisions about recruitment spend. If LinkedIn is generating high-quality candidates and employee referrals aren't converting well, we should shift budget accordingly. I also want visibility into whether our offer terms are competitive - if we're seeing low acceptance rates, that's a red flag that needs executive attention.

---

**Q: What are the main things you want this to contain? What metrics? What analyses or charts or questions?**

A: For metrics, the critical ones are: number of open positions, active candidates in the pipeline, average time-to-hire, and offer acceptance rate. Those four tell me the health of our hiring operation at a glance.

For analysis, I want a visual funnel showing where candidates are in the process and where they're dropping off. I want to see time-to-hire broken down by position so we can spot which roles are problematic. I want source effectiveness - both volume and quality of candidates by channel. And I want hiring velocity over time so we can see if we're building momentum or stalling out.

---

**Q: Can you tell me how this general area functions? Processes, people, etc. How do you view it and manage it? How do you decide if things are going well or not?**

A: Our recruitment process follows a standard pipeline: we source candidates from various channels - LinkedIn, job boards, employee referrals, sometimes external recruiters. Candidates move through screening calls, usually 2-3 rounds of interviews depending on the role, then we extend offers. The whole thing is coordinated by our HR managers who work with hiring managers to schedule interviews and move candidates through.

Right now, I manage this through weekly status meetings where HR managers verbally report on their positions. It's inefficient and backward-looking. I decide things are going well based on gut feel - are positions closing on time? Are we getting complaints from hiring managers? Are we losing candidates to competitors? I want to replace gut feel with actual data.

The red flags I look for: positions open longer than 60 days, multiple interview rounds without movement, offer rejections clustering around specific roles or compensation levels, over-reliance on expensive external recruiters. But currently I only see these red flags after they've become problems, not when they're emerging trends.

---

**Follow-up Q: What would success look like for this dashboard in concrete terms?**

A: If an HR manager can open the dashboard and within 30 seconds tell me which positions need attention and why, that's success. If we can answer "where are we with the Software Engineer position?" without logging into three different systems, that's success. If we're using the dashboard data in our monthly recruitment planning meetings to make budget decisions, that's success. Basically, if this becomes the single source of truth that people actually use daily rather than another report that sits unopened, we've won.

---

**Follow-up Q: Are there any specific compliance or access considerations we should be aware of?**

A: Yes, candidate PII needs to be protected. HR managers can see candidate data since that's their job, but we need to be careful about hiring managers potentially accessing sensitive information. Role-based access is important. Also, this dashboard will contain data that could be commercially sensitive if we're tracking recruiter effectiveness and costs, so we can't have this widely accessible beyond the HR team and relevant leadership.
